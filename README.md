# Hi, I'm Lily 👋

I'm a Senior Business Analyst & Requirements Engineer with 20+ years of experience across finance, insurance, telecom, luxury retail, and airline operations. I specialize in bridging business and IT, driving digital transformation, and designing clear, scalable processes that actually work in practice.

## What I do

- **Business analysis & requirements engineering** – IREB-certified, with a strong focus on clarity, traceability, and stakeholder alignment  
- **Process optimization** – BPMN, UML, and end-to-end process redesign for efficiency and transparency  
- **Agile delivery** – Experience with Scrum, SAFe, and Kanban in complex organizations  
- **Digital transformation & automation** – From concept to implementation, including data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement  
- **Cross-domain expertise** – Banking, insurance, telecom, collections, luxury retail, and airline operations  

## What you'll find here

This GitHub space is my professional knowledge hub. Here I share and develop:

- **Business analysis & requirements templates** (user stories, acceptance criteria, stakeholder maps, checklists)  
- **Process models** (BPMN and UML examples, process documentation)  
- **Digital transformation playbooks** (frameworks, lessons learned, patterns that work)  
- **Learning projects** as I explore automation, analytics, and AI-supported ways of working  

Even when there is no “code”, there is always **structure, logic, and value**.

## Currently exploring

- AI-assisted business analysis and process optimization  
- Practical automation concepts (e.g. RPA, dashboards, workflow tools)  
- How to better connect strategy, operations, and technology in large organizations  

## How I work

- **Bridge-builder:** I translate between business, IT, and operations so everyone talks about the same thing.  
- **Pragmatic:** I care about outcomes, not buzzwords.  
- **Collaborative:** I enjoy co-creating solutions with stakeholders and teams, not working in a silo.
